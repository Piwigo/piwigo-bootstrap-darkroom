### Usage

1. Installation:

 * or download from http://piwigo.org/ext/extension_view.php?eid=831

3. Disable the smartpocket theme (it's enabled by default). This is required in order to use Bootstrap Darkroom by default on mobile devices, too.

### Recommended Plugins for best mobile user experience
* [GThumb+](http://piwigo.org/ext/extension_view.php?eid=591) or [gdThumb](http://piwigo.org/ext/extension_view.php?eid=771): this will give you masonry-style thumbnail pages that make most use of valuable space.
* [RV Thumbnail Scroller](http://piwigo.org/ext/extension_view.php?eid=493): this one will load items on the thumbnails page as they are requested using ajax, ideal for swiping through albums while keeping the initial page load size small. Avoids pagination.

### Known issues

* In IE11, the navbars only display correctly if using fluid-width layout.
* On iOS the PhotoSwipe fullscreen mode isn't supported. On iPhone it does work in landscape orientation only, on iPad it doesn't work at all. That's an iOS bug. Works just fine on Android
* Plugins that add buttons to the Navbar might not (yet) be supported, see [Plugin Support Matrix](https://github.com/tkuther/piwigo-bootstrap-darkroom/wiki/Plugin-Support-Matrix)
* Portrait mode videos (e.g. from mobile phones) need to be recoded in actual portrait orientation, rotation tags won't work.

### Development & Customizing
* All stylesheets are compiled from Bootstrap's Sass source files using node-sass.
* Dependencies are managed using yarn. Dist dependencies are separated from the usual npm bloat using .gitignore tricks
* To install build dependencies, use
```
npm install yarn && yarn install
```

The build process is based on npm scripts and uses common shell functions, so it might not work on Windows.

To build everything, use
```
npm run build
```
To build only bootswatch, for example, use
```
npm run build:bootswatch
```
See [package.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkuther/piwigo-bootstrap-darkroom/master/package.json) for available script commands.

There is built-in support for a custom Sass build.
* Create the file _scss/custom/custom.scss_
* Include all required Boostrap stuff in there, override variables as you wish, just like any custom bootstrap build
* Compile with `npm run build:custom`
* Select "Custom" style in the theme's configuration

### Thanks
* Phil Bayfield for his work on the Bootstrap Default theme, which this theme was initiallly based on as a child theme. It's grown up now.
* The Piwigo Team for a great gallery software
* The Piwigo translation team
